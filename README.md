## Overview

This document provides detailed reflections on the portfolio artifacts I submitted as part of the Artemis Financial project. It demonstrates my ability to conduct a vulnerability assessment and implement secure software practices.

## Client Summary

**Question: Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements.**

**Answer:**
Artemis Financial is a financial services provider that needed a comprehensive security assessment to protect its sensitive financial data. The main requirements were to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in their web applications and software infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Reflections on Software Security Practices

**Question: What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

**Answer:**
I did well at identifying critical security vulnerabilities such as input validation issues and configuration weaknesses. Coding securely is vital because it protects against data breaches, maintains customer trust, and complies with regulations. Software security is crucial for a company’s wellbeing as it ensures the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data, thereby protecting the company from potential financial and reputational harm.

## Challenges in Vulnerability Assessment

**Question: What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

**Answer:**
The manual review of the code and configurations was the most challenging due to its complexity. However, the use of automated static analysis tools was particularly helpful as it complemented the manual review by identifying and confirming vulnerabilities efficiently.

## Security Enhancements

**Question: How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

**Answer:**
I increased security by updating vulnerable components, enhancing input validation, and securing configurations. In the future, I plan to use a combination of manual reviews, automated testing tools, and regular security audits to find vulnerabilities and fix mitigation techniques.

## Ensuring Code Security

**Question: How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

**Answer:**
To ensure the application was secure and functional, I conducted secondary and functional testing. After refactoring the code, I used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to detect any new potential vulnerabilities, ensuring the refactoring did not compromise the security.

## Resources and Tools

**Question: What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

**Answer:**
I used AES for encryption, HTTPS for secure communications, and SSL/TLS configurations. These practices, along with tools like OWASP Dependency-Check for managing software vulnerabilities, will be beneficial in future projects.

## Demonstrating Skills to Employers

**Question: Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

**Answer:**
I would show the detailed vulnerability assessment report and the documentation on secure software practices. These documents demonstrate my ability to secure applications and manage software security, showcasing my skills and knowledge in a practical scenario.
